<h1>
  My portofolio:
</h1>
<p>I have worked a lot during my education with designing websites and programming. 
  The programs that I’m most familiar with is html, css and java. I have also experience with design, 
  especially with logo design, as I have an example of down below. Digital marketing is something 
  I have also worked on in the past. </p>
<h2>Logo design project:</h2>

  <img src="https://scontent.fosl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/242991317_542068896891166_7776258945629982752_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=islVHHv2uo4AX_dUyCz&_nc_ht=scontent.fosl1-1.fna&oh=c39d35e4494e8cf2406955c61096541e&oe=6179B2A7" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="400" align="bottom" >

<p>
  This project is one of my favorite projects, and I have put both my heart  
  and soul into this piece of art. The project was named "the healthy chair  
  project", and ended up with being my most successful projects yet. in this 
  logo design i have focused on keeping it simple and sticking with just the 
  black and orange colors. the text and logo match the color scheme, which 
  makes the logo pleasing to look at.

<h2>Website project:</h2>

<p>
  This is a website i have worked on for a long time and it turned out 
  pretty good. I made this website for a company that was working with 
  making camping products like a thermos and similar products. In the 
  website i have added a header with the logo of the company along with 
  their name and an interactive menu bar. I chose to put an image of a 
  tent which makes the user of the website more intrigued and excited 
  to continue exploring the website. The website also includes a footer.
</p>
<h2>Restaurant project:</h2>
<img src="https://colorlib.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/restaurant-wordpress-themes1.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="400" align="bottom">
<p>
This website is probaly the biggest project i have worked on. The project was a
team project which is where my experience with negotiation and communication skills are from.
The project required not only clear communication among the webdesigners but also between the designers and the buyers. 
This was important when it comes to creating the ideal page for the buyer.
  
</p>

<h2>About the page</h2>
<p>Before we started this assignment we sat down as a group and made a short sketch of what we wanted the website to look like. We tried to decide what semantic tags we wanted to include in our website. Even though everyone on our group is fairly new to using HTML, we tried our best to include as many as possible. We started with a header where we added our fictional characters name plus a menu bar. We then added a body to our website, where we wrote most of the content. Here we included paragraphs and pictures. 

We decided to make our website this way because it seemed the most simple way to structure our website, even though our code might seem a little messy.
